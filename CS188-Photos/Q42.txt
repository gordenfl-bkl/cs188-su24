Answer: The human would be better off using Dianabot rather than Albertbot when the expected reward of using Dianabot is greater than the expected reward of using Albertbot.

Explanation:

Let's denote the expected reward of using Dianabot as E(D) and the expected reward of using Albertbot as E(A).

The condition under which the human is better off using Dianabot rather than Albertbot is E(D) > E(A).

To find the values of E(D) and E(A), you would need to calculate the expected rewards based on the probabilities and outcomes in the expectimax trees for Dianabot and Albertbot.

The exact calculations would depend on the specific probabilities and outcomes involved.
